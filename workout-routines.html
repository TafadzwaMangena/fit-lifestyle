                <h2>Effective weekly workout routine</h2>
                <p>You'll want to find a well-balanced workout routine you can stick to to reap the benefits of physical
                    activity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises at least 150 minutes of
                    moderate-intensity physical activity per week, which is 30 minutes per day, five days per week. The
                    CDC also recommends two days of muscle-strengthening activities.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Your workout routine depends on your goals, such as building muscle and gaining strength. Here's a
                    sample weekly workout schedule by Jacklyn Romano, CPT, a certified physical therapist based in New
                    Jersey, and Sharon Gam, PhD, a certified personal trainer and health coach, to help you figure out
                    your goals and get started.</p>

                    <h3>Monday:</h3>
                    <h4>Cardio</h4>
                    <p>Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity, such as biking, jogging, running, and walking.
                        The CDC recommends that you aim for moderate intensity, meaning a heart rate between 64% and 76%
                        of your maximum heart rate.You'll be able to hold a conversation while exercising. Vigorous
                        intensity, in contrast, means that you can only say a few words without pausing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A good rule of thumb for finding your maximum heart rate is subtracting your age from 220. Your
                        maximum heart rate would be 175 beats per minute (bpm), for example, if you are 40. You'll aim
                        for a heart rate between 112 bpm and 133 bpm.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Steady-state cardio (endurance workouts) improve the stamina of your heart and lungs and reduce
                        the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Your body learns to move oxygen and nutrients
                        into your muscles more efficiently while transporting waste out.As a result, those exercises
                        will become easier over time, so you'll want to</p>

                    <h3>Tuesday:</h3>
                    <h4>Lower body</h4>
                    <p>With four compound lifts, your first muscle-strengthening session of the week will target your
                        lower body, including your hamstrings, glutes, and quads. Compound lifts are exercises that use
                        multiple muscle groups. A deadlift, for example, works your lower body and your arm and core
                        muscles.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Do 10 reps for three sets, with a minute of rest between each set, of the following exercises:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deadlifts:</strong> Place your feet shoulder-width apart, push your butt back, bend
                            your knees
                            slightly, and bend forward, keeping your back straight. Grasp a barbell or pair of dumbbells
                            with your hands. Lift the weights by driving your hips forward while keeping your back flat.
                            Slowly lower the weights back to the floor.</li> <br>
                        <li><strong>Hip thrusts:</strong> Sit on the ground with your shoulders on a bench or stable chair behind you.
                            Keep your feet planted on the ground, and then push your hips up. Squeeze your glutes until
                            your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Lower your hips back to the ground.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Lunges:</strong> Stand in a split stance, so one foot is a few feet in front of the other. Keep your
                            torso straight, and then bend your knees until your back knee is a few inches from the floor
                            and your front thigh is parallel to the floor. Push through your heels to return to the
                            starting position. Repeat this move on the opposite sides.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Squats:</strong> Lower yourself like you are sitting in a chair. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart
                            and your feet flat on the floor. Push back up to standing.</li>
