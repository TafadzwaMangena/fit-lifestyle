                <h2>Effective weekly workout routine</h2>
                <p>You'll want to find a well-balanced workout routine you can stick to to reap the benefits of physical
                    activity.</p>
                <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises at least 150 minutes of
                    moderate-intensity physical activity per week, which is 30 minutes per day, five days per week. The
                    CDC also recommends two days of muscle-strengthening activities.</p>
                <p>Your workout routine depends on your goals, such as building muscle and gaining strength. Here's a
                    sample weekly workout schedule by Jacklyn Romano, CPT, a certified physical therapist based in New
                    Jersey, and Sharon Gam, PhD, a certified personal trainer and health coach, to help you figure out
                    your goals and get started.</p>

                    <h4>Cardio</h4>
                    <p>Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity, such as biking, jogging, running, and walking.
                        The CDC recommends that you aim for moderate intensity, meaning a heart rate between 64% and 76%
                        of your maximum heart rate.You'll be able to hold a conversation while exercising. Vigorous
                        intensity, in contrast, means that you can only say a few words without pausing.</p>
                    <p>A good rule of thumb for finding your maximum heart rate is subtracting your age from 220. Your
                        maximum heart rate would be 175 beats per minute (bpm), for example, if you are 40. You'll aim
                        for a heart rate between 112 bpm and 133 bpm.</p>
                    <p>Steady-state cardio (endurance workouts) improve the stamina of your heart and lungs and reduce
                        the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Your body learns to move oxygen and nutrients
                        into your muscles more efficiently while transporting waste out.As a result, those exercises
                        will become easier over time, so you'll want to</p>

                    <h3>Tuesday:</h3>
                    <h4>Lower body</h4>
                    <p>With four compound lifts, your first muscle-strengthening session of the week will target your
                        lower body, including your hamstrings, glutes, and quads. Compound lifts are exercises that use
                        multiple muscle groups. A deadlift, for example, works your lower body and your arm and core
                        muscles.</p>
                    <p>Do 10 reps for three sets, with a minute of rest between each set, of the following exercises:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deadlifts:</strong> Place your feet shoulder-width apart, push your butt back, bend
                            your knees
                            slightly, and bend forward, keeping your back straight. Grasp a barbell or pair of dumbbells
                            with your hands. Lift the weights by driving your hips forward while keeping your back flat.
                            Slowly lower the weights back to the floor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hip thrusts:</strong> Sit on the ground with your shoulders on a bench or stable
                            chair behind you.
                            Keep your feet planted on the ground, and then push your hips up. Squeeze your glutes until
                            your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Lower your hips back to the ground.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lunges:</strong> Stand in a split stance, so one foot is a few feet in front of the
                            other. Keep your
                            torso straight, and then bend your knees until your back knee is a few inches from the floor
                            and your front thigh is parallel to the floor. Push through your heels to return to the
                            starting position. Repeat this move on the opposite sides.</li>
                        <li><strong>Squats:</strong> Lower yourself like you are sitting in a chair. Keep your feet
                            shoulder-width apart
                            and your feet flat on the floor. Push back up to standing.</li>

                    <h4>Upper Body and Core</h4>
                    <p>Your legs, which are likely feeling sore, will get a break since you'll be focusing on your arms
                        today. You'll target your biceps, triceps, and chest muscles with these moves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bicep curl: </strong> Hold a dumbbell in each hand or grasp a barbell with both
                            hands. Let your elbows rest at your sides with your forearms extended out parallel to the
                            floor. Bend your elbows to bring the weight to your shoulders and then return to the start
                            position.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chest press: </strong> Lie back on a bench with your feet flat on the floor, holding
                            a dumbbell in each hand or a barbell in both. Keep your arms perpendicular to your body and
                            palms facing forward. Extend your elbows, pushing the weight up. Lower the weight to return
                            to the starting position.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tricep dip: </strong> Sit on a chair or bench and then grip the edge next to your
                            hips. Slide your butt off the chair and lower yourself so your elbows are bent at a 45- or
                            90-degree angle. Push yourself back to the starting position.</li>

                        Finish this session with a quick core circuit. Pick some of your core moves—such as crunches,
                        planks, and Russian twists—and do each one for 30 seconds with 10–15 seconds off. Repeat the
                        exercises until you hit 10–15 minutes.</p>

                    <h3>Thursday:</h3>
                    <h4>Active Rest and Recovery</h4>
                    <p>Give your body a chance to recover and recharge. Muscle-strengthening activities create tiny
                        microtears in your muscle fibers, leaving your muscles achy and sore. That may sound alarming,
                        but it actually means your muscles will grow back stronger than before. Not allowing your
                        muscles to recover heightens your injury risk and prevents your muscles from strengthening.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You may get some form of movement in, even on off days, if you are not too sore or tired. Active
                        rest might include walking and stretching, which relieves post-workout muscle tightness.</p>

                    <h4>Lower Body With a Focus on Glutes</h4>
                    <p>This lower body session will focus on your glutes. Warm up your glutes with five resistance band
                        exercises, such as bridges, clamshells, and squats, for three rounds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You'll move on to weighted exercises once you activate your glutes. Romano recommended doing 10
                        reps for three sets of hinge movements, including deadlifts, hip thrusts, and single-legged hip
                        thrusts. Those exercises target your glutes and hamstrings.</p>

                    <h4>Upper Body</h4>
                    <p>Focus on your back and shoulders for your final workout of the week. You'll want to fire up your
                        muscles before jumping into the weights. Try doing three sets of 10 reps each of push-ups and
                        pull-ups. You can modify with incline push-ups and assisted pull-ups until you build more
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>You'll then complete five weighted exercises for 10 reps and three sets. Those exercises include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dumbbell single-arm row: </strong> Place one hand under your shoulder, arm straight,
                            on a bench. Rest your corresponding knee on the bench, keeping your other leg out to the
                            side and your foot flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in your other hand, rowing your elbow
                            up to your side until it's parallel to the floor. Lower and repeat on the other side.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lat pull down:</strong> Grab the bar of a cable machine with your palms facing away
                            and shoulder-width apart. Make sure you are seated on a bench or kneeling on the floor. Pull
                            the bar down to your chest before returning slowly to the starting position.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lateral raise:</strong> Standing or sitting with a dumbbell in each hand and arms at
                            your sides, engage your core and slowly lift the weights out to the side until your arms are
                            parallel to the floor. Slowly return to the starting position.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reverse fly:</strong> With your feet shoulder-width apart, bend slightly at your
                            waist, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Raise both arms out to the side, squeezing your
                            shoulder blades together. Return to the starting position.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Shoulder press: </strong> Either seated or standing, hold a dumbbell in each hand at
                            shoulder height. Keep your palms facing away and elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. Press the
                            weights up until your arms are straight and the weights touch overhead. Slowly lower to the
                            starting position.

                    <h4>Rest and Recovery Day</h4>
                    <p>Celebrate your week of hard work by giving your body time to recover. You can try yoga or
                        stretching to prevent your muscles from getting too stiff and sore.</p>
                    <p>It's OK to take a complete rest day, too. Both active and relaxed days off have a place in our
                        weekly routine, whether that's reading a book on the couch or catching up on Netflix. What
                        matters most is that you listen to your body.</p>
